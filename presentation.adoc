== Starting Point

* https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breuninger[Breuninger] operates 14 luxury fashion stores in Germany.
* For 2020 it was announced that there will be a new POS system.
* The old one was only monitored with ping checks in PRTG.

[CAUTION,step=1]
**We can do better and we already have Prometheus!**

== POS System Overview

[.notes]
--
The new system is build in layers. There is a Linux based cloud instance as centralized backend service.
It's operated by my team, so it was easy to integrate it with our existing prometheus infrastructure and we won't care too much about it today. 

For each store we have a local server backend which replicate data from the stores to the cloud.
This backend is running on virtualize windows server instances with static ip config.

// Monitoring cloud native workloads is easy. Everything which is billable has an API.
// But in a on premise world there is no native API.

== POS Device Architecture

[.notes]
--
The actual cash registers are windows based desktop systems in an appropriate design
and other peripherals such as card terminals and receipt printers.

* Windows based desktop systems
** _Metrics via https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter[windows_exporter]_
* Running Java based POS application
** _Custom exporter on Powershell_
** _Planned: https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter[JMX exporter]_
* Peripherals like payment terminals
** _Metrics via https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter[Blackbox Exporter]_

== Service Discovery

--
* There is no API describing the the current known POS devices
** _This is the real world - no cloud native features available_
* POS devices are no static deployment
** _They can be out of service for maintenance_
** _There are systems that are only active when required_
--

[WARNING,step=2]
How does Prometheus know which POS systems are currently active? +
*Excel and manual adjustments in files are not an option!*


== Introducing Netbox

--
* Python based web application for IP address management *(IPAM)* and Datacenter infrastructure management *(DCIM)*
* Capable of managing *devices* and *virtual machine's life cycle*.
* Powerful **APIs** and **extensions**
--

[CAUTION, step=1]
NetBox provides the "source of truth" to power automation

== Connecting Netbox with Prometheus

[WARNING, step=1]
There is no native integration of Netbox and Prometheus

[step=1]
__but we have some options...__


== `static_config`

[.notes]
--
* Classic approach for third party SD
* Scrape targets periodically and dump them to a file
--

__The classic approach__

* üëç Easy to implement as a sidecar
* üëç No adjustments on Netbox

* üëé New component on each Prometheus
* üëé Requires multiple API calls for each device
* üëé Requires additional monitoring of the sidecar

[step=1]
https://github.com/FlxPeters/netbox-prometheus-sd

== `http_sd`

[.notes]
--
* Modern way of integration with third party SD sources
* Move the knowledge back to the source
* Just a new view on the Netbox API
--

__Fetch targets dynamically via HTTP__

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/#comparison-between-file-based-sd-and-http-sd[Introduced] in Prometheus 2.28.0 as alternative to `static_config`

* üëç No sidecar on Prometheus
* üëç Full power of the Netbox API (filters etc.)
* üëç No replicated filter flags on the sidecar
* üëç Less API calls

* üëé Requires adjustments/plugin on Netbox

== Demo

== Conclusion

* Netbox and Prometheus are a perfect match for monitoring targets without a cloud native API or inventory
* Not only useable for POS devices - also for network devices and bare metal infrastructure

== Bonus

TIP: Give the Engineers a reason to document: +
     By coupling documentation and monitoring, we always have up-to-date and maintained documentation of the environment.
