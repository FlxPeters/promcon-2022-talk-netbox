== Starting Point

* https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breuninger[Breuninger] operates 14 luxury fashion stores in Germany.
* For 2020 it was announced that there will be a new POS system.
* The old one was only monitored with ping checks in PRTG.
* We had the claim to monitor this better

CAUTION: We love Prometheus!

== POS System Overview

[.notes]
--
The new system is build in layers. There is a Linux based cloud instance as centralized backend service.
It's operated by my team, so it was easy to integrate it with our existing prometheus infrastructure and we won't care too much about it today. 

For each store we have a local server backend which replicate data from the stores to the cloud.
This backend is running on virtualize windows server instances with static ip config.

// Monitoring cloud native workloads is easy. Everything which is billable has an API.
// But in a on premise world there is no native API.

== POS Device Architecture

[.notes]
--
The actual cash registers are windows based desktop systems in an appropriate design
and other peripherals such as card terminals and receipt printers.

* Windows based desktop systems
** _Metrics via https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter[windows_exporter]_
* Running Java based POS application
** _Metrics custom exporter_
** _Planned: https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter[JMX exporter]_
* Peripherals / Card terminals with IP
** _Metrics via https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter[Blackbox Exporter]_

== Service Discovery

[step=1]
--
* There is no API describing the the current known POS devices
** _This is the real world - no cloud native features available_
* POS devices are no static deployment
** _They can be out of service for maintenance_
** _There are systems that are only active when required_
--

[WARNING,step=2]
How is Prometheus supposed to know which POS systems are currently active? +
*Excel and manual adjustments in files are not an option!*


== Introducing Netbox

[.notes]
--
NetBox is the leading solution for modeling and documenting modern networks.
By combining the traditional disciplines of IP address management (IPAM) and datacenter infrastructure management (DCIM)
with powerful APIs and extensions, NetBox provides the ideal "source of truth" to power network automation.
--

--
* Python based web application for IP address management *(IPAM)* and Datacenter infrastructure management *(DCIM)*. +
* Also capable of managing non rack *devices* and *virtual machines life cycle*.
* Has a *REST-API* and supports *Plugins*
--

[CAUTION, step=1]
Source of truth about all entities - If it has an IP it's in Netbox

== Connecting Netbox with Prometheus

[WARNING, step=1]
There is no native integration of Netbox and Prometheus

== `static_config`

* üëç Easy to implement as a sidecar
* üëç No adjustments on Netbox

* üëé New component on each Prometheus
* üëé Requires multiple API calls for each device
* üëé Requires additional monitoring of the sidecar

[step=1]
https://github.com/FlxPeters/netbox-prometheus-sd

== `http_sd_config`

https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/#comparison-between-file-based-sd-and-http-sd[Introduced] in Prometheus 2.28.0 as alternative to `static_config`

* üëç No sidecar on Prometheus
* üëç Less API calls

* üëé Requires adjustments/plugin on Netbox

[step=1]

== Demo

== Conclusion

* Netbox and Prometheus are a perfect match for monitoring targets without a cloud native API or inventory
* Not only useable for POS devices - also for network devices and bare metal infrastructure

TIP: Give the Engineers a reason to document: +
    _By coupling documentation and monitoring, we always have up-to-date and maintained documentation on the rolled-out status._
